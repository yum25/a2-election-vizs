            created a few live trackers on local elections and voting wait times
            for election day (November 5th, 2024). These graphics were displayed
            during the day of the election, but have since been taken down - so
            I've decided to compile them here and explain some of the processes
            and methods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first graph on the top shows the registration wait times on
            Monday, November 4th. The second graph shows the registration wait
            times on Tuesday, November 5th. While registration times peaked at
            around 100 minutes the day before the election, election day was
            much calmer, with a steady and small stream of voters throughout the
            day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            According to staff at the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the
            actual wait times were usually shorter than the reported wait times,
            which were generally reported as 1 person in line = 1 minute of wait
            time. To reflect this, we used a <b>0.7</b> multiplier to accurately
            display the actual time in line.

            The data scraper was built a few days in advance using Python with
            an AWS Lambda function. Using AWS EventBridge, we scraped the
            <a
              href="https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Elections/Pages/Line-Tracker.aspx"
              >City of Ann Arbor website</a
            >
            every 5 minutes for updated wait times. Due to registration wait
            times being tracked the week before the election, we had a decent
            amount of time for test runs of the scraper before the day of!

          Our second tracker scraped data using the same methodology as our wait
          times tracker, and displayed
          <a

          as data began to come in. While the maps were live updating, we used
          dashed lines to represent that votes were still being counted.
